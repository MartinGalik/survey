                    After launching application you can see already existing surveys 
                    and you can choose one to edit it or create brand new one. After choosing survey next window 
                    is opened in which user chooses from Questions of that which one
                    to edit or create a new one. Survey's title and description can 
                    changed here. Next window shows that question's answers and type
                    of question. Answers can be created or edited here.

                I was member of four-member team. Together we did our best to
                complete our assignment - survey management system. I was
                responsible for a Java application part, which could be used by
                the front end side to work with the database.

            <para>
                I worked with Jakub Gavlas and Peter Petkanic to create a
                user friendly graphic user interface for a survey management
                system. Used to create new surveys and edit already existing
                ones.

            <title>SurveyEngine.java</title>
            <para>
                This class works with the xml database, namely the file
                <emphasis>survey.xml</emphasis>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Class can load a survey from the file and return it, load a map
                of surveys and their IDs or save a file that is given to it.
                File is always validated against <emphasis>schema.xsd</emphasis>
                to make sure it's still valid. If a survey is being saved, it's
                also checked to be correct before it's saved into the file.
